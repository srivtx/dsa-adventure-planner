# Dynamic Video Search Feature

## What's Implemented

âœ… **Dynamic Video Search**: The app now searches for videos based on the problem title instead of using static links.

âœ… **Top 3 Results**: Shows the top 3 video results for each problem.

âœ… **User Choice**: Users can choose which video to watch from the search results.

âœ… **Progress Tracking**: Each video can be marked as watched individually.

## How It Works

1. **When you click "ðŸŽ¬ Watch Video"**:
   - The app shows a loading message
   - Searches for videos related to the problem title
   - Displays top 3 results with titles and descriptions
   - Lets you choose which video to watch

2. **Search Query**: 
   - Uses the problem title + "algorithm tutorial explanation"
   - Example: "Two Sum algorithm tutorial explanation"

3. **Mock Data** (Current Implementation):
   - For demo purposes, it returns realistic mock video results
   - Each video has a title, description, and embed URL
   - In production, you would connect to a real video search API

## Next Steps to Make It Fully Functional

### Option 1: YouTube Data API (Recommended)
1. Get a YouTube Data API v3 key from Google Cloud Console
2. Replace the mock implementation with real API calls
3. Update the `getVideoResources` method to use your API key

### Option 2: Alternative Video Search
1. Use other video platforms (Vimeo, etc.)
2. Implement web scraping (may violate terms of service)
3. Use third-party APIs that aggregate video content

### Option 3: Curated Video Database
1. Create a database of curated videos for each problem type
2. Manually select high-quality educational videos
3. Store video IDs and metadata in your app

## Current Features

- âœ… Dynamic search interface
- âœ… Multiple video options per problem
- âœ… Progress tracking per video
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Error handling for no results

## Test It Out

1. Open your DSA app
2. Navigate to any problem
3. Click "ðŸŽ¬ Watch Video"
4. You'll see 3 mock video results
5. Click on any video to watch
6. Mark videos as watched to track progress

The foundation is ready - you just need to connect it to a real video search API!
